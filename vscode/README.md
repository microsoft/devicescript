# DeviceScript

**Professional TypeScript-like developer experience for low-resource microcontroller-based devices.**
DeviceScript is compiled to a custom VM bytecode, which can run in very constrained
environments.

## Telemetry

This extension collects telemetry data to help us build a better experience working remotely from VS Code. We only collect data on which commands are executed. We do not collect any information about image names, paths, etc. The extension respects the `telemetry.enableTelemetry` setting which you can learn more about in the [Visual Studio Code FAQ](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting).
