# DeviceScript Language

DeviceScript brings a professional TypeScript developer experience to low-resource microcontroller-based devices.
DeviceScript is compiled to a custom VM bytecode, which can run in very constrained
environments (VM itself compiles to 10kB of code, with the floating point library and Jacdac SDK adding further 30kB).
