# Differences with JavaScript

This document lists differences in semantics between DeviceScript and EcmaScript/JavaScript/TypeScript
(referred to as JS in this document).

## Strings

The method `String.charCodeAt()` returns a Unicode code point (up to 21 bits), not UTF-16 character.
See [discussion](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/discussions/34).

String encoding is currently UTF-8 which make [indexing linear](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/issues/40),
and [construction by concatnation quadratic](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/issues/39).
This may be fixed in future, see linked issues.

## Prototypes

Care needs to be taken when using index operator (`obj[some_expression]`) as some properties might
be tree-shaken away.
You can use `ds.keep()` function to make sure methods are included.
See [discussion](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/discussions/36).

In JavaScript assigning properties on strings is a no-op. It is an error in DeviceScript.
In both reading these properties returns `undefined`.

## Numbers

DeviceScript doesn't support subnormals, that is numbers is range around -5e−324 to 5e-324 are rounded to zero
(this includes negative zero).
Subnormals are [not required by the JS specs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MIN_VALUE).

The comparisons with `NaN` behave as in JS (and IEEE standard), in particular `NaN !== NaN`.

## "Attached" properties

JS lets you attach properties to arrays, buffers, functions, etc. in addition to regular map objects.
In DeviceScript properties cannot be attached to functions and statically allocated buffers.
Properties can be attached to roles, dynamic buffers, and of course regular map objects.

## Expressions

Assignments do not return value (i.e., you cannot say `x = y = 1` or `if (x = foo()) { ... }`).
