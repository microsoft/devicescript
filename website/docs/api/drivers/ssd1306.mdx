## Hardware configuration

-   Configure the I2C connection through the [board configuration](/developer/board-configuration)
-   Check that you are using the proper I2C address

## Display

The driver implements the [Display](/developer/graphics/display) interface and can be used as various services.
Using the driver through services provides a better simulation experience.

## Driver

You can also use the SS1306 driver directly. However, it will not be usable from a simulator.

-   [Source](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/blob/main/packages/drivers/src/ssd1306.ts)

```ts

const ssd = new SSD1306Driver({ width: 64, height: 48 })
await ssd.init()
ssd.image.print("Hello world!", 3, 10)
await ssd.show()
```
