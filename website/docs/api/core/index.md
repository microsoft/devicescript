DeviceScript provides builtin support for instantiating **Jacdac service clients (role)**
and binding them to **Jacdac servers (sensors)**. Jacdac services are an abstraction layer that allow you to program in DeviceScript without having to enter the details of the hardware implementation.

Once a role is bound to a service server, DeviceScript provides the API to access its

-   [registers](/api/core/registers)
-   [events](/api/core/events)
-   [commands](/api/core/commands)

Additional runtime components

-   [Buffer](/api/core/buffers)
