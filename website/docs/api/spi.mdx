# SPI

The SPI [builtin package](/developer/packages) that exposes functions to read, write, transfer buffers over SPI.

## `spiConfigure`

The `spiConfigure` function is used to configure the SPI bus. It takes the pin configuration, frequency and mode.

```ts
import { spiConfigure } from "@devicescript/spi"

await spiConfigure({})
```

## `spiRead`

The `spiRead` function is used to read a buffer from the SPI bus.

```ts
import { spiRead } from "@devicescript/spi"

const res = await spiRead(8) // read 8 bytes
```

## `spiWrite`

The `spiWrite` function is used to write a buffer to the SPI bus.

```ts
import { spiWrite } from "@devicescript/spi"

await spiWrite(hex`abcd`)
```

## `spiTransfer`

The `spiTransfter` function is used to write and read buffers from and to the SPI bus.
The read buffer has the same length as the write buffer.

```ts
import { spiTransfer } from "@devicescript/spi"

const res = await spiTransfer(hex`abcd`)
```
