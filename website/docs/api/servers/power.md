# Power

This will generally be configured in the [board.json](/devices/add-board) file,
so the `startPower()` function should not be used.

The power service is used to control a current limiter delivering power to the Jacdac bus.

See also [power service spec](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/services/power).
