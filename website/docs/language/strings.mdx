# Strings and Unicode

ECMAScript spec requires `String.charCodeAt()` to return a 16-bit value.
Unicode code points outside of 16-bit (mostly emoticons, but also some historical alphabets, 
and rare Chinese/Japanese/Korean ideograms) are represented as surrogate pairs of two 16-bit code units.
The `String.length` returns the number of UTF-16 code units in the string.

If ES was designed today they would probably return up to 21-bit values from `charCodeAt()`, 
or possibly use yet another abstraction since even with full 21-bit Unicode, 
several code points can still combine into a single glyph (character displayed on the screen). 

In DeviceScript,
the method `String.charCodeAt()` returns Unicode code point (up to 21 bits), not UTF-16 character.
Similarly, `String.length` will return the number of 21-bit code points.
Thus, `"🗽".length === 1` and `"🗽".charCodeAt(0) === 0x1f5fd`,
and also `"\uD83D\uDDFD".length === 1` since `"\uD83D\uDDFD" === "🗽"` which may be confusing.
