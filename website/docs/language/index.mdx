# DeviceScript Language

DeviceScript is a programming language for scripting [Jacdac](https://aka.ms/jacdac) services in embedded devices.

It has TypeScript-like syntax and is compiled to a custom VM bytecode, which can run in very constrained
environments.

DeviceScript generally works just like TypeScript, unless the compiler tells you something is not supported.
Please check [semantic differences between DS and JS](/language/ds-vs-js) for differences
that the compiler can't warn you about.
