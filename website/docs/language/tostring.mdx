# toString() method

ECMAScript spec requires converting values to string, deep in the internals of the runtime
(in particular, in `a + b`, `a[b]`, `a == b`, etc.).
It also mandates that these conversions use the `.toString()` method if provided on the object
by the user.

These are complex to implement in very limited stack space available on embedded devices.
Consider the following: `.toString()` triggers code execution with
say property indexing, which triggers another `.toString()`, etc.
See [issue](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/issues/41).

To alleviate this problem, the built-in string conversion for objects in DeviceScript
is similar to `util.inspect()` in node.js - it will show a limited number of object fields.
For example:

```ts
const o = { x: 1, y: ["foo", 2] }
console.log("o=", o)
console.log("o=" + o)
console.log(`o=${o}`)
```

```console title="Output"
o={x:1,y:["foo",2]}
o={x:1,y:["foo",2]}
o={x:1,y:["foo",2]}
```
