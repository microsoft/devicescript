# JSX

[JSX](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html)is an embeddable XML-like syntax.
It is meant to be transformed into valid JavaScript,
though the semantics of that transformation are implementation-specific.
JSX rose to popularity with the [React](https://react.dev/) framework,
but has since seen other implementations as well. TypeScript supports embedding, type checking, and compiling JSX directly to JavaScript.

DeviceScript supports JSX compilation as documented in the TypeScript documentation.

## Sample

The `@devicescript/ui` is a sample UI framework based on a set of TSX functional components.
It is designed to be used with small LCD screens such as the [SSD1306](/api/servers/ssd1306).
