# JSX/TSX

[JSX](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html) is an embeddable XML-like syntax (.tsx for TypeScript files).
It is meant to be transformed into valid JavaScript,
though the semantics of that transformation are implementation-specific.
JSX rose to popularity with the [React](https://react.dev/) framework,
but has since seen other implementations as well. TypeScript supports embedding, type checking, and compiling JSX directly to JavaScript.

DeviceScript supports TSX compilation as documented in the TypeScript documentation.

## Sample

The [sampleui](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/tree/main/packages/sampleui) package is a sample UI framework based on a set of TSX functional components.
It is designed to be used with small LCD screens such as the [SSD1306](/api/servers/ssd1306).

This snippet show a potential use of the JSX syntax to render a progress bar on a screen.

```tsx skip
pot.reading.subscribe(async (pos: number) => {
    await renderOnImage(
        <HorizontalGauge
            y={12}
            width={image.width}
            height={12}
            value={pos}
            showPercent={true}
        />,
        image
    )
    await ssd.show()
})
```

If you are familiar with React developement, the implementation of `HorizontalGauge` will feel familiar.

```tsx skip
export function HorizontalGauge(props: {
    x?: number
    y?: number
    width: number
    height: number
    value: number
    showPercent?: boolean
}): JSX.Element {
    const { x, y, width, height, value, showPercent } = props
    const w = Math.round((width - 4) * value)
    const fc = value > 0.5 ? 0 : 1
    return (
        <Translate x={x} y={y}>
            <Rect width={width} height={height}></Rect>
            <FillRect x={2} y={2} width={w} height={height - 4} />
            {!!showPercent && (
                <Style fillColor={fc}>
                    <Text x={width / 2} y={2}>
                        {Math.round(value * 100) + "%"}
                    </Text>
                </Style>
            )}
        </Translate>
    )
}
```

## Where are the UI frameworks?!!?!

We do not provide a fully fledge UI framework on top of the JSX compilation support.
The sample is very limited (no layout, no dom, no virtual DOM, ...).
If you feel up to the challenge, we recommend having a try at it!
