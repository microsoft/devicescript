# Board Configuration

**To target a specific hardware board or peripherical,
you need to configure the pins, I2C, SPI, etc...** This is done by loading the
board configuration package for your specific hardware.

The inserted board configuration exposes a `pins` object that you can use to
configure drivers.

```ts
// highlight-next-line
import { pins } from "@dsboard/adafruit_qt_py_c3"
import { startLightBulb } from "@devicescript/servers"

const lightBulb = startLightBulb({
    // highlight-next-line
    pin: pins.A0_D0,
})
```

:::tip

In Visual Studio Code, on the file menu, click on the **wand** icon and select the board configuration.
If your board is already connectd, DeviceScript will automatically detect it and
load the correct board configuration.

## Available Boards

You can find the list of supported devices and configuration in
the [devices](/devices) catalog.

## Configuration by Code

You can also configure the board by code using the `configureHardware` function.

Some board configuration are generic and the I2C pins are not configured by default.
For example, the [pico-w](/devices/pico-w) board configuration does not configure
the I2C pins and the code below configure them by code.

```ts
// highlight-next-line
import { configureHardware } from "@devicescript/servers"
import { pins } from "@dsboard/pico_w"

// highlight-start
configureHardware({
    i2c: {
        pinSDA: pins.GP4,
        pinSCL: pins.GP5,
    },
})
// highlight-end
```
