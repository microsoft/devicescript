# Graphics

The `@devicescript/graphics` package provides an `Image` type support which can be used to author efficient driver for small screens
such as the [SSD1306 LCD scree](/api/servers/ssd1306).

```ts
import { Image } from "@devicescript/graphics"

const img = Image.alloc(128, 64, 1)
```

## Image

The `Image` represents a space-optimized pateletted image, with either 1 or 4 bit per pixels.

### `img`

`img` is a [template literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) that allows to declare images from ASCII art.
The compiler will automatically generate an image in flash.
This image is initially readonly; if you modify it, the runtime will internally allocate a buffer in RAM for it.

The image format is the grid of pixels with either `.` or the palette color index (`#` treated as 1).

```ts
import { img } from "@devicescript/graphics"

const i = img`
    . . . 4 . . . . . .
    . 2 2 2 2 2 . . . .
    . 2 7 7 . 2 . . . .
    . 2 7 7 . 2 . . . .
    . 2 . . . 2 . . . .
    . 2 2 2 2 2 . . . .
    . . . . . . . . . .`
```

### Rendering context

You can create a rendering context for an image; that provides a HTML canvas-like API (smaller subset).

```ts
import { Image } from "@devicescript/graphics"

const img = Image.alloc(128, 64, 1)
const ctx = img.getContext()

ctx.fillText(":)", 0, 0)
```
