# Drivers

Drivers [builtin package](/developer/packages) provides drivers for [I2C peripherals](./i2c)
and [digital gpio](./gpio).

## Usage

```ts
import { startSHTC3 } from "@devicescript/drivers"

const { temperature, humidity } = await startSHTC3()
```

## What about missing drivers?

So the driver you need isn't here? There are a few options:

-   [Search on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=devicescript) where a community member may have already published a driver.
-   [Check if a request is already open](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/labels/driver%20request)
-   [Create a Driver Request](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=) to request a new driver. We can't guarantee that we'll have time to implement it, but we maybe someone in the community will!
