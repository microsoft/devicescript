# Servers

In DeviceScript, any hardware component is accessed through a service **client**.
Therefore, you need to start service **servers** on top of your
low level hardware components to program them using DeviceScript.

## [Analog](/developer/servers/analog) (builtin) servers

DeviceScript provides helper functions to mount of variety of servers out of the box
in the `@devicescript/servers` module.

For example, the [startButton](/api/servers/button) function allows to mount a [button server](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/services/button)
over a pin and returns the [client](/api/clients/button) for it.

```ts no-run
import { gpio } from "@devicescript/core"
import { startButton } from "@devicescript/servers"

const buttonA = startButton({
    pin: gpio(2),
})
```

Once you've add this code to your script, you can interact with pin `2` (hardware specific identifier) through the `buttonA` client.
The variable name is automatically used as the **role** and **instance** name.

```ts no-run
import { gpio } from "@devicescript/core"
import { startButton } from "@devicescript/servers"

const buttonA = startButton({
    pin: gpio(2),
})
buttonA.up.subscribe(() => {
    console.log("up!")
})
```

## [Digital IO](/developer/servers/digital-io)

Servers can be implemented using digital IO
and are either built-in from C or authored in DeviceScript directly.

## [I2C](/developer/servers/i2c)

Servers can be implemented using I2C
and are either built-in from C or authored in DeviceScript directly.

## [SPI](/developer/servers/spi)

Servers can be implemented using SPI
and are either built-in from C or authored in DeviceScript directly.

## Jacdac modules

If you connect a [Jacdac module](https://aka.ms/jacdac), it will automatically run as a service server and
you will be available to bind a role to that module.

For example, the KittenBot KeyCap button will surface as a **button server** when connected.

## Serial, PWM

Serial, PWM are not supported yet at the DeviceScript level.
