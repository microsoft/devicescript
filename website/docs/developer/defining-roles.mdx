# Defining Roles

In DeviceScript, all access to sensors, actuators or other hardware components are abstracted through [Jacdac](https://aka.ms/jacdac) services. Sensors act as **servers** and your scripts connects **clients** to interact with them.

To interact with Jacdac services, you define **roles** for each service you need.

In this scenario, we will need to measure air pressure and send HID mouse commands. Therefore, we declare a `airPressure` role and a `hidMouse` role.

```ts edit
import * as ds from "@devicescript/core"

console.log(`starting...`)
const sensor = new ds.AirPressure()
const mouse = new ds.HidMouse()
```

:::note

For consistency and breivity, the `@devicescript/core` module
is implicitely imported as follows:

```ts skip no-run
import * as ds from "@devicescript/core"
```

## Where are the servers?

Now you are probably wondering how you convert your existing low level components into services? We'll cover that in the next step.
