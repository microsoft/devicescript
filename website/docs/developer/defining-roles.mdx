# Defining Roles

In DeviceScript, all access to sensors, actuators or other hardware components
are abstracted through [Jacdac](https://aka.ms/jacdac) services.
Sensors act as **servers** and your scripts connects **clients** to interact with them.

To interact with servers, you start clients, known as **roles**, for each service you need.

Let's illustrate these concept with a controller for a home heating system.
The heating system has a relay to turn on/off the furnace, a temperature sensor and
rotary encoder to change the desired temperature.
Therefore, we declare 3 roles.

```ts
import * as ds from "@devicescript/core"

const thermometer = new ds.Temperature()
const encoder = new ds.RotaryEncoder()
const relay = new ds.Relay()
```

:::note

For consistency and breivity, the `@devicescript/core` module
is implicitely imported as follows:

```ts skip no-run
import * as ds from "@devicescript/core"
```

## Where are the servers?

Now you are probably wondering how you convert your existing low level components into services? We'll cover that in the next step.
