# Encrypted Fetch

The `@devicescript/net` package contains `encryptedFetch()` function which lets you
HTTP POST encrypted data and read encrypted responses.
The encryption uses `aes-256-ccm`.

Let's see how this works!

First, set up a `main.ts` file:

```ts
import { assert } from "@devicescript/core"
import { URL, encryptedFetch } from "@devicescript/net"
import { readSetting } from "@devicescript/settings"

async function sendReq(data: any) {
    const url = new URL(await readSetting<string>("ENC_HTTP_URL"))
    const password = url.hash.split("pass=")[1]
    assert(
        password !== "SecretPassword",
        "Please change password in production!"
    )
    url.hash = ""
    return await encryptedFetch({
        data,
        password,
        url,
    })
}
console.log(
    await sendReq({
        hello: "world",
    })
)
```

Second, create a settings file with secrets.

```env title="./.env.local"
# Local settings and secrets
# This file should **NOT** tracked by git
# Make sure to put the value below in "..."; otherwise the # gets treated as comment
ENC_HTTP_URL="http://localhost:8080/api/devs-enc-fetch/mydevice#pass=SecretPassword"
```

In production, you may want to use `deviceIdentifier('self')` as the user name,
provided you handle that server-side.

On the server side, you can run the code below.
Feel free to adopt to other languages or frameworks.

:::warning

Two devices should never share a key.

    if (url.pathname.replace(/.*\//, "") == deviceId) {

        if (pass !== "SecretPassword") return pass

## Technical description

The `encryptedFetch()` function performs as HTTP request which uses `content-type` of `application/x-devs-enc-fetch`
and two special headers.
The `x-devs-enc-fetch-algo` header contains information about the request encryption algorithm
and can be safely ignored.
The `x-devs-enc-fetch-salt` contain a string salt value for HMAC key derivation function (HKDF) from RFC 5869.

The `encryptedFetch()` function also requires a password, which should be long-ish
random string (with about 256-bits of entropy).
The key for AES encryption is derived using HKDF based on the password and previously
generated salt; the `info` parameter is set to `""`.
This key is used for both encryption and authentication of the request.

The body of the request is a JSON object.
Before sending it out, `encryptedFetch()` extends it with a random request identifier (stored in `$rid` property).
The JSON object is converted to a buffer and
encrypted using AES-256-CCM and an 8-byte authentication tag is appended.
The initialization vector (IV) is all-zero.

This is sent to the server, which decrypts the request accordingly.

:::warning

If applicable, the server should check if a request with a given `$rid` was already handled,
and if so, reject it.
Otherwise, someone can replay a client request.

:::

If the server responds with `2xx` code, the response is assumed to be
a JSON object encrypted using a key derived using HKDF from the password,
the previously generated salt, and `info` parameter set to the value
of `x-devs-enc-fetch-info` in the response.
IV is all zero.
The response also has the 8-byte authentication tag.

If the response is not `2xx` or if it cannot be authenticated an exception is thrown.
Otherwise, the JSON object of the response is returned.

## Security

From the device standpoint, if the salt is unique, the device can be sure
only someone with the password can read the request or generate a response.
Response cannot be replayed, since the key for it incorporates the salt.

From the server standpoint, a man-in-the-middle attacker can intercept
a device request and either delay it or send it again at later time.
Thus, server should check for uniqueness of the `$rid` if this can be a problem.
The attacker will not be able to deduce anything about the contents of the response
even if the server doesn't ignore a duplicate request, since the `info` parameter
send from server is incorporated in the response key and it is random.
