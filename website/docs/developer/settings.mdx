# Settings

Settings [builtin package](/developer/packages) provides a friendly layer to read/write objects from the device flash. **Keep it small, there's not a lot of space!**

## Usage

The settings store is cleared on each deployment. It is recommended to use the `readSetting` and `writeSetting` functions to access the settings store.
The functions are asynchronous and return a promise.

### `.env` file

You can store secrets in the `./.env` file at the root of the project (**make sure it is in `.gitignore`**).
The file should be in the following format:

```env
# This is a comment
PASSWORD=VALUE
TEMP=68
```

where the value can be any valid JSON (parsed automatically) or a string.

:::note

Note that multiline values, and `#` in quote strings are not supported.

:::

### `readSetting`

Deserializes an object from a setting at a given key. If the key is missing or invalid format, returns undefined.

```ts
import { readSetting } from "@devicescript/settings"

// highlight-next-line
const { world } = await readSetting<{ world?: string }>("hello", {})
```

### `writeSetting`

Serializes an object into a setting at a given key. The key name should be less than 16 characters.

```ts
import { writeSetting } from "@devicescript/settings"

// highlight-next-line
await writeSetting("hello", { world: "world" })
```
