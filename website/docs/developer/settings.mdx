# Settings

Settings provide a friendly layer to read/write objects from the device flash. **Keep it small, there's not a lot of space!**

## Setup

Configure your project for testing using this command

```bash
devs add settings
```

## Usage

### `writeSetting`

Serializes an object into a setting at a given key. The key name should be less than 16 characters.

```ts
import { writeSetting } from "@devicescript/settings"

// highlight-next-line
await writeSetting("hello", { world: true })
```

### `readSetting`

Deserializes an object from a setting at a given key. If the key is missing or invalid format, returns undefined.

```ts
import { readSetting } from "@devicescript/settings"

// highlight-next-line
const world = await readSetting("hello")
```
