# Testing

DeviceScript provides a unit test framework that runs on the device. It has a syntax similar to Jest/Mocha/Chai.

## Setup

Configure your project for testing using this command

```bash
devs add test
```

## Defining tests

The test framework provides the popular BDD test contructs: `describe`, `test` (`it`), `expect`.

```ts
import { describe, test, expect, runTests } from "@devicescript/test"

describe("this is a test suite", () => {
    test("this is a test", () => {
        expect(1).toBe(1)
    })
})

await runTests()
```

## Package

The test framework is implemented in the [@devicescript/test](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devicescript/test) package.
