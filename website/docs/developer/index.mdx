# Developer

The DeviceScript developer experience is designed to be friendly with developers familiar with TypeScript projects.
DeviceScript uses the TypeScript syntax and the developer tooling does not require any special hardware

## Try DeviceScript

You can try out DeviceScript directly from this documentation site, use the [Visual Studio Code extension](/getting-started/vscode) or [command line tool](/getting-started/cli).

```ts edit codesandbox
setInterval(() => {
    console.log(`hello`)
}, 1000)
```

-   Click `Edit` to load the snippet in the developer tools
-   [Getting started with Visual Studio](/getting-started/vscode)
-   [Getting started with command line](/getting-started/cli)

:::tip
If you are developing the C++ firmware for DeviceScript,
you will need a more traditional embedded development setup.
