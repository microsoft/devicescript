# Development Gateway

The `@devicescript/cloud` [builtin package](/developer/packages) provides a cloud agnostic device to cloud API
that allows to send and receive small JSON messages to an online gateway.
The gateway can route the messages into any further cloud service.

As a proof of concept, DeviceScript can be connected to the Development Gateway.

:::tip

This API is only supported on ESP32 devices currently.
