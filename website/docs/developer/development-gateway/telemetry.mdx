# Application Telemetry

You can collect usage telemetry of your DeviceScript using `trackEvent` or `trackMetric`

When connected to the gateway, the device is modelled as a user and the connection as a session.
The data is injected directly
in [Application Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview)
and can be analyzed through the Azure portal.

### Exceptions

The `trackException` method uploads an exception to Application Insights. The stacktrace information is expanded in the gateway.

```ts
import { trackException } from "@devicescript/cloud"

try {
    throw new Error("noes!")
} catch (e) {
    // highlight-next-line
    await trackException(e as Error)
}
```

### Events

The `trackEvent` method creates custom events in application insights. The event may be buffered or sampled
to reduce the network load.

```ts
import { trackEvent } from "@devicescript/cloud"

// highlight-next-line
await trackEvent("started")
```

### Metrics

The metric aggregates a numerical value and upload the aggregate when requested.

```ts
import { Temperature } from "@devicescript/core"
import { createMetric } from "@devicescript/cloud"

const thermo = new Temperature()
// highlight-next-line
const temp = createMetric("temp")
// highlight-next-line
thermo.reading.subscribe(async t => temp.add(t))
setInterval(async () => {
    // highlight-next-line
    await temp.upload()
}, 30000)
```
