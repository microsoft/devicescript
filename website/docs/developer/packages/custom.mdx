# Publishing a DeviceScript package

Using npm, GitHub releases, or other package manager is the recommended way to share your DeviceScript code.
The process is very similar to publishing packages for node.js/web on npm.

Here are some examples of custom packages:

-   [Adafruit.io create data](https://github.com/pelikhan/devicescript-adafruit-io/) to upload sensor data to io.adafruit.com
-   [Blues.io note api](https://github.com/pelikhan/devicescript-note) to interact with blues.io notecard

## Getting started

To create a DeviceScript library from your project, run this command
or use **DeviceScript: Add npm...** from the command palette in Visual Studio Code.

```bash
yarn devs add npm
```

This will:

-   remove the `"private"` field from `package.json`
-   add `"devicescript": { "library": true }` (this is required)
-   set `"main": "src/index.ts"` (`src/index.ts` is created if missing)
-   set `"files"` field
-   add `"license"`
-   add `"keywords": ["devicescript"]` - keep this so npm search works better!
-   add `"author"` and `"repository"` if they can be inferred

All of these can be of course edited in `package.json` afterwards.

After this step, you can publish your package using your favorite npm publishing pipeline.

## Naming convention

In particular it's recommended to name your package `devicescript-something`.

## Development notes

Note that regular DeviceScript applications typically use `src/main.ts` (or `src/mainSomething.ts`)
as the application entry point.
This is typically, **not** the right choice for **library** entry point.

You can keep your `src/main.ts` file as an example or test for the library,
but best to stick to `"main": "src/index.ts"` in `package.json`.
