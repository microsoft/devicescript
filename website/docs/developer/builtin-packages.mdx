# Builtin Packages

The packages are dropped by the DeviceScript compiler whenever you run build.
They do not need to be `npm install`ed.

-   `@devicescript/core` - the core package exposing the C runtime and Jacdac services
-   `@devicescript/server` - support for writing Jacdac servers in DeviceScript
-   `@devicescript/test` - [testing framework](/developer/testing)
-   `@devicescript/observables` - [reactive observables](/developer/observables)
-   `@devicescript/cloud` - [cloud connectivity](/developer/cloud)
-   `@devicescript/i2c` - interacting with [I2C peripherals](/developer/cloud)
-   `@devicescript/settings` - reading/writing [settings in flash memory](/developer/cloud)
-   `@devicescript/drivers` - [drivers for I2C peripherals](/developer/drivers)

## Adding Builtin Packages

This is only relevant for developers of DeviceScript compiler and runtime.

Generally, search for `@devicescript/settings` within the workspace.
The main places that need updating is:

-   this file, `website/docs/developer/builtin-packages.mdx`
-   list in `plugin/src/plugin.ts`
-   list in `devs/run-test/allcompile.ts`
