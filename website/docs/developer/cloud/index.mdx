# Cloud

The `@devicescript/cloud` package provides a cloud agnostic device to cloud API
that allows to send and receive small JSON messages to an online gateway.
The gateway can route the messages into any further cloud service.

As a proof of concept, DeviceScript can be connected to the [Development Gateway](/developer/cloud/gateway).

## Installation

Add `@devicescript/cloud` in your project.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @devicescript/cloud
```

## Usage

-   [Application Telemetry](cloud/telemetry), track application usage and errors
-   [Message queues](cloud/messages), upload and subscribe to message queues

## Development Gateway

This package relies on a prototype Development Gateway that needs to be deployed prior to using it.

-   [Development Gateway](cloud/gateway)
