## Upload Message

DeviceScript will stringify and upload your object as a JSON payload. The gateway add this messages
into an [Azure Event Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/event-hubs/), additonal sinks can be configured online.

```ts
import { uploadMessage } from "@devicescript/cloud"

// highlight-next-line
await uploadMessage("topic", { msg: "hello" })
```

:::tip

Keep those field names very short as the payload needs to be small (`< 236` bytes).
