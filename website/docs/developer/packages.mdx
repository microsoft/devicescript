# Packages

DeviceScript supports packages published in [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or any other package manager compatible
with the `package.json` specification.

Currently, only TypeScript code can be published - in future we may add [services](custom-services).

## Using other DeviceScript packages

-   [Search for `devicescript` on npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=devicescript).
    By convention, DeviceScript-compatible packages should be marked with the `devicescript` keyword.

-   Add the package the usual way, like here to add [devicescript-cowsay](https://www.npmjs.com/package/devicescript-cowsay)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install devicescript-cowsayß
```

## Publishing a DeviceScript package

Using npm or other package manager is the recommended way to share your DeviceScript code.
The process is very similar to publishing packages for node.js/web on npm.

### Getting started

To create a DeviceScript library from your project, run this command
or use **DeviceScript: Add npm...** from the command palette in Visual Studio Code.

```bash
devs add npm
```

This will:

-   remove the `"private"` field from `package.json`
-   add `"devicescript": { "library": true }` (this is required)
-   set `"main": "src/index.ts"` (`src/index.ts` is created if missing)
-   set `"files"` field
-   add `"license"`
-   add `"keywords": ["devicescript"]` - keep this so npm search works better!
-   add `"author"` and `"repository"` if they can be inferred

All of these can be of course edited in `package.json` afterwards.

After this step, you can publish your package using your favorite npm publishing pipeline.

### Naming convention

In particular it's recommended to name your package `devicescript-something`.

### Development notes

Note that regular DeviceScript applications typically use `src/main.ts` (or `src/mainSomething.ts`)
as the application entry point.
This is typically, **not** the right choice for **library** entry point.
You can keep your `src/main.ts` file as an example or test for the library,
but best to stick to `"main": "src/index.ts"` in `package.json`.
