# MCU Temperature

Microcontrollers typically have a temperature sensor built in. This is a great way to monitor the temperature of the MCU itself.
The temperature sensor is not very accurate, but it is good enough to detect if the MCU is overheating.

The `mcuTemperature` function returns the temperature in degrees Celsius.

```ts
import { mcuTemperature } from "@devicescript/runtime"

setInterval(async () => {
    const temp = await mcuTemperature()
    console.log({ temp })
}, 1000)
```

The simulator temperature is always 21 degrees Celsius.
