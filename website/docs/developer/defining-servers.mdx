# Defining Servers

In DeviceScript, any hardware component is accessed through a service **client**.
Therefore, you need to start service **servers** on top of your
low level hardware components to program them using DeviceScript.

## Built-in servers

DeviceScript provides helper functions to mount of variety of servers out of the box
in the `@devicescript/servers` module. Basically, you have access to all the drivers available in the [C server SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-c/tree/main/drivers),
including GPIO, analog and I2C based sensors.

For example, the [startButton](/api/servers/button) function allows to mount a [button server](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/services/button)
over a pin and returns the [client](/api/clients/button) for it.

```ts no-run
import { startButton } from "@devicescript/servers"

const buttonA = startButton({
    pin: 2,
})
```

Once you've add this code to your script, you can interact with pin `2` (hardware specific identifier) through the `buttonA` client.
The variable name is automatically used as the **role** and **instance** name.

```ts no-run
import { startButton } from "@devicescript/servers"

const buttonA = startButton({
    pin: 2,
})
buttonA.up.subscribe(() => {
    console.log("up!")
})
```

## Jacdac modules

If you connect a [Jacdac module](https://aka.ms/jacdac), it will automtically run as a service server and
you will be available to bind a role to that module.

## Custom servers

Those are not supported yet. Stay tuned.
