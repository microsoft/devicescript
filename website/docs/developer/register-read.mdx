# Register read

You can retreive the current value of a register by calling `read`.
Internally, the client will handle all the necessary syncronization and communication with the sensor.

## read

```ts skip no-run
const pressure = await sensor.pressure.read()
```

Let's modify the snippet by `reading` the `pressure` reading
and logging it to the console.

## subscribe

```ts edit
console.log("starting...")
const sensor = new ds.AirPressure()
// listen for every pressure reading
sensor.pressure.subscribe(pressure => {
    console.log(pressure)
})
```

## observables

DeviceScript provides an (optional) micro-observable implementation which allows to create filtering pipelines for streamed sensor data. Each registers is an observable of sensor data.
The observables are bundled in the `@devicescript/observables` package.

In the example below, we pipe the register data through a `threshold` operator to only stream data entries once a significant change is detected.

```ts skip
import { threshold } from "@devicescript/observables"
console.log("starting...")
const sensor = new ds.AirPressure()
// listen for every pressure reading
await sensor.pressure
    .pipe(
        threshold(1) // at least 10 hPa change to trigger callback
    )
    .subscribe(pressure => {
        console.log(pressure)
    })
```
