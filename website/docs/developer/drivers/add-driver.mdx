# Add a driver

New drivers can be integrated into the [devicescript GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/tree/main/packages/drivers/src) or published as a npm package.

To get started and understand what needs to be done, [look at existing drivers](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/tree/main/packages/drivers/src).

## How to

-   create a new TypeScript file in the [developer/drivers](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/tree/main/packages/drivers/src) folder
-   add export entry in [devicescript/blob/main/packages/drivers/src/index.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/blob/main/packages/drivers/src/index.ts)
-   add a new class and decorate it with description, `@url`, `@devsPart` and `@devsWhenUsed`. Typically you can use the sensor name as the class name to make it easier for search.

```ts skip
/**
 * Support for Badger 2040 W (Pico W Aboard)
 *
 * @url https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/badger-2040-w
 * @devsPart Pimoroni Pico Badger
 * @devsWhenUsed
 */
export class PimoroniBadger2040W { ... }
```

The documentation summary will be used as a title and DeviceScript will automatically extract this class using the @devsPart information.

-   add additional hardware configuration in the constructor

```ts skip
    constructor() {
        configureHardware({
            i2c: {
                pinSDA: pins.GP4,
                pinSCL: pins.GP5,
            }
        })
    }
```

-   add helper function to start mount server on sensors

```ts skip
    startLED() {
        return startLightBulb({
            pin: pins.GP22,
            dimmable: true,
        })
    }
```

-   add a documentation page under `website/docs/api/drivers`
-   add a sample under `website/docs/samples`, the picture can be added to `website/static/pics/samples`
-   prepare a pull request and send away!
