# Analog

There is a number of functions that start a simple analog sensor server.
We'll use `startPotentiometer()` as an example, but you can use any of the following,
as they all use the same configuration.

{@import ../../devices/analog.mdp}

In the simplest case, you just pass the pin to `startPotentiometer()`.
The voltage on the pin (typically between 0V (GND) and 3.3V (VCC)) will be translated to a number between 0 and 1.

```ts
import { gpio } from "@devicescript/core"
import { startPotentiometer } from "@devicescript/servers"

const slider = startPotentiometer({
    pin: ds.gpio(3),
})
slider.reading.subscribe(v => console.data({ value: 100 * v }))
```

## Scaling

There are two settings, `offset` and `scale` that let you modify the value read from the sensor.
The actual reported reading is `(offset + (raw_reading * scale) / 1024) / 0xffff`
clamped to `0 ... 1` range.
The range of `raw_reading` is `0 ... 0xffff`.
The defaults are `{ offset: 0, scale: 1024 }` so the `raw_reading` is just reported back.

For example, if you find you can never quite reach the `0` and `1` values, you can try the following:

```ts
import { gpio } from "@devicescript/core"
import { startPotentiometer } from "@devicescript/servers"

const slider = startPotentiometer({
    pin: ds.gpio(3),
    offset: 0x1000,
    scale: 900,
})
```

## Limiting power consumption

A potentiometer typically has 3 terminals, let's call them L, M, R.
You connect L to GND, R to VCC and M (middle) to the sensing pin.
The M terminal will then get a voltage proportional to the position of the knob.

However, the current (0.3mA with typical 10kOhm potentiometer) will always flow from L to R,
regardless if you measure it or not.
To improve power consumption, you may connect say R to a GPIO and configure the service like this:

```ts
import { gpio } from "@devicescript/core"
import { startPotentiometer } from "@devicescript/servers"

const slider = startPotentiometer({
    pin: ds.gpio(3),
    pinHigh: ds.gpio(7),
})
```

This tells the driver to set GPIO7 (`pinHigh`) to 1 (3.3V) before taking the measurement
from GPIO3 (`pin`).
After taking the measurement, `pinHigh` will be left floating, so no current will flow through the potentiometer.

You can also set `pinLow` (which is set to 0 before taking measurement) or both `pinHigh` and `pinLow`,
but typically one is enough.

## Timings

The `samplingItv` settings defaults to 9 milliseconds and specifies how often to sample the sensor.

The `streamingItv` setting defaults to 100 milliseconds and specifies how often to stream values
on the Jacdac bus.
The client can override this through `streaming_interval` Jacdac register.

Additionally, you can set `samplingDelay` to a number of milliseconds to wait after setting `pinHigh`/`pinLow`
before taking the measurement
(default is 0, so effectively a few microseconds (not milliseconds)).
