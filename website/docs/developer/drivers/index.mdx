# Drivers

In DeviceScript, any hardware component is accessed through a service **client**.
A **driver** implement one or more service **servers** for a given hardware peripherical.

The [drivers builtin package](/developer/packages) exposes drivers for a number of periphericals.

## [Analog](/developer/drivers/analog) (builtin)

DeviceScript provides helper functions to mount a variety of servers out of the box
in the `@devicescript/servers` module.

For example, the [startButton](/api/drivers/button) function allows your script
to mount a [button server](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/services/button)
over a pin and returns the [client](/api/clients/button) for it.

```ts no-run
import { gpio } from "@devicescript/core"
import { startButton } from "@devicescript/servers"

const buttonA = startButton({
    pin: gpio(2),
})
buttonA.up.subscribe(() => {
    console.log("up!")
})
```

Once you've added this code to your script, you can interact with pin `2`
(hardware specific identifier) through the `buttonA` client. The variable name is
automatically used as the **role** and **instance** name.

## [Digital IO](/developer/drivers/digital-io)

Drivers can be implemented using digital IO
and are either built-in from C or authored in DeviceScript directly.

```ts
import { gpio, GPIOMode } from "@devicescript/core"
import "@devicescript/gpio"

const p0 = gpio(0)
await p0.setMode(GPIOMode.Output)
await p0.write(true)
```

## [I2C](/developer/drivers/i2c)

Drivers can be implemented using I2C
and are either built-in from C or authored in DeviceScript directly.

```ts skip
import { i2c } from "@devicescript/i2c"

...
await i2c.writeReg(address, register, value)
```

## [SPI](/developer/drivers/spi)

Drivers can be implemented using SPI
and are either built-in from C or authored in DeviceScript directly.

```ts skip
import { spi } from "@devicescript/spi"

...
await spi.write(hex`abcd`)
```

## What about missing drivers?

So the driver you need isn't here? There are a few options:

-   [Search on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=devicescript) where a community member may have already published a driver.
-   [Check if a request is already open](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/labels/driver%20request)
-   [Create a Driver Request](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=) to request a new driver. We can't guarantee that we'll have time to implement it, but we maybe someone in the community will!

## Jacdac modules

If you connect a [Jacdac module](https://aka.ms/jacdac), it will automatically run as a service server and
you will be able to bind a role to that module.

For example, the KittenBot KeyCap button will surface as a **button server** when connected.

## Serial, PWM

Serial, PWM are not supported yet at the DeviceScript level,
however specific PWM uses (such as servos, buzzers, light bulbs, motors)
are supported through `@devicescript/servers`.
