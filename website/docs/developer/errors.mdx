# Errors

## loopback rx ovf {#loopback-rx-ovf}

The program is issuing requests to service client faster than the system can handle.

## can't connect, no HF2 nor JDUSB {#no-hf2}

On ESP32-C3, we do not support external serial chips. This is the [list of known supported ESP32 boards](/devices/esp32).

## esptool cannot connect {#esptool-cannot-connect}

If the `esptool` complains about not being able to connect, try plugging your board in
while holding `IO0`/`BOOT` button.

## I2C device not found or malfunctioning {#i2c-device-not-found-or-malfunctioning}

There is a number of reasons why this error message will appear. A few common ones
are due to invalid configurations, aside from hardware issues with the sensor.

-   Check that the I2C pins have been configured. Read about [board configuration](/developer/board-configuration).
-   The I2C address is incorrect. Check the datasheet for the correct address.
-   The I2C address is correct, but the sensor is not responding. Check the wiring and the sensor datasheet.
