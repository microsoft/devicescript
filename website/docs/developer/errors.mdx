# Errors

## loopback rx ovf {#loopback-rx-ovf}

The program is issuing requests to service client faster than the system can handle.

## can't connect, no HF2 nor JDUSB {#no-hf2}

On ESP32-C3, we do not support external serial chips. This is the [list of known supported ESP32 boards](/devices/esp32).

## esptool cannot connect {#esptool-cannot-connect}

If the `esptool` complains about not being able to connect, try plugging your board in
while holding `IO0`/`BOOT` button.
