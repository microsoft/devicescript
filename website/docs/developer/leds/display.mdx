# LED Display

You can wrap an LED matrix as a [Display](/developer/graphics/display)
and render graphics to it as if it was just another screen.

```ts
import { Led } from "@devicescript/core"
import { startLedDisplay } from "@devicescript/runtime"

const led = new Led()
// highlight-next-line
const display = await startLedDisplay(led)
// render
display.image.print(`Hello world!`, 3, 10)
// and show
await display.show()
```

The palette is automatically inferred from the `waveLength` register; otherwise you can provide one.

```ts skip
const display = await startLedDisplay(led, palette)
```
