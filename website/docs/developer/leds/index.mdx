# LEDs

Controlling strips of programmable LEDs can be done through the `Led` client.

**This client requires to import the `@devicescript/runtime` to get all the functionalities.**

```ts
import { Led } from "@devicescript/core"
// highlight-next-line
import "@devicescript/runtime"

const led = new Led()
```

## Driver

You can start a driver for WS2812 or AP102 using [startLed](./leds/driver).

```ts
import { LedVariant } from "@devicescript/core"
import { startLed } from "@devicescript/drivers"

// highlight-start
const led = await startLed({
    length: 32,
    variant: LedVariant.Ring,
})
// highlight-end
```

:::tip

Support for hardware strips is still under constructions. Currently, simulation is supported
but hardware in progress.

## PixelBuffer and show

The `Led` client has a [pixel buffer](/api/runtime/pixelbuffer), a 1D vector of colors,
that can be used to perform color operations, and a `show` function to render the buffer to the hardware.

A typical LED program would then look like this:

```ts
import { Led } from "@devicescript/core"
import { fillSolid } from "@devicescript/runtime"

const led = new Led()
// retreive pixel buffer from led
const pixels = await led.buffer()
// do operations on pixels, like setting LEDs to green
fillSolid(pixels, 0x00ee00)
// send colors to hardware
await led.show()
```

### showAll

A convenience function `showAll` is provided to set the color of all LEDs.

```ts
import { Led } from "@devicescript/core"
import "@devicescript/runtime"

const led = new Led()
// highlight-next-line
await led.showAll(0x00ee00)
```

## LED Display

You can mount a LED matrix as a [display](./leds/display).
This can be helpful for matrix-shaped LEDs.

```ts
import { Led } from "@devicescript/core"
import { startLedDisplay } from "@devicescript/runtime"

const led = new Led()
// highlight-next-line
const display = await startLedDisplay(led)
```
