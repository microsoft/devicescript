# LED Driver

You can start a driver for WS2812 or AP102 using `startLed`.

```ts
import { LedVariant } from "@devicescript/core"
import { startLed } from "@devicescript/drivers"

// highlight-start
const led = await startLed({
    length: 32,
    variant: LedVariant.Ring,
})
// highlight-end
```

## Gamma correction

The Led has a [Gamma correction](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/led-tricks-gamma-correction.pdf)
factor of 2.8 by default. Gamma correction is applied before rendering the colors
to account for how our eyes sense the light created by LEDs.

```ts skip
const led = await startLed({
    // highlight-next-line
    gamma: 2.2

})
```


## Simulation and long strips (> 64 LEDs)

For short LED strips, 64 LEDs or less, DeviceScript provides full simulation and device twin
for hardware and simulated devices.

For strips longer than 64 LEDs, the simulator device will work but the hardware device twin will
not work anymore. This is a simple limitation that the data overflows the packets used in Jacdac.
