# Console output

DeviceScript supports basic `console` functionality
which allows you to add logging to your script.

```ts edit
console.log(`starting...`)
```

## Try it out

-   [ ] Click on `Edit` to load code snippets into the DeviceScript
        developer tools. The developer tools should open within the documentation page (large screen recommended).

By default, the snippet will run in a virtual DeviceScript virtual machine (running in the browser), we'll see later how to run on hardware.

-   [ ] Notice that the `starting...` entry is visible in the `Console` section of the dev tools.
