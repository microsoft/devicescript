# Command Line

The command line tool is compatible with container and virtual machines so you can run it
in Docker, GitHub Codespaces, ...

## Setting up the project

Let's get started by installing the [DeviceScript command line](/api/cli) and create an empty project

-   Open a terminal in a new folder
-   install [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if not already installed
-   Use the `init` command to setup a new project

```bash
npx --yes @devicescript/cli@latest init
```

You will have the following files created.

```
.devicescript/     reserved folder for devicescript generated files
package.json       projet configuration
devsconfig.json    configure the DeviceScript compiler with additional flags,
                   also used by VSCode extension to activate.
src/               directory for DeviceScript sources
src/main.ts        usual name for your entry point application
src/tsconfig.json  configure the TypeScript compiler to compile DeviceScript syntax
...
```

-   open `src/main.ts` and copy the following code

```ts title="src/main.ts"
import * as ds from "@devicescript/core"
import { debounceTime, filter } from "@devicescript/observables"

const sensor = new ds.AirPressure()
const mouse = new ds.HidMouse()
// listen for pressure changes
sensor.reading
    .pipe(
        filter(pressure => pressure > 1400),
        debounceTime(500)
    )
    .subscribe(async () => {
        console.log(`click!`)
        await mouse.setButton(
            ds.HidMouseButton.Left,
            ds.HidMouseButtonEvent.Click
        )
    })
```

## Launch the build watch

Assuming `src/main.ts` is the root file of your application,
launch a compilation task in watch mode using this command.

```bash
devs devtools src/main.ts
```

or, for short,

```bash
yarn watch
```

The command line task will also start a local web server that will send the compiled bytecode
to a developer tools page similar to the one hosted in the docs.

-   open the developer tools page, typically http://localhost:8081/ (see cli output)
-   use te developer tools page similarly to the embedded docs page

## Edit, deploy, debug loop

From here, your developer inner loop will be very similar to building/debugging a web site with hot reload.

-   make an edit in your source file, say `src/main.ts`
-   after a couple seconds, the compiler picks up the changes, produces a new bytecode and sends it to the developer tools
-   the developer tools automatically deploy the bytecode to the select device (by default the simulator)
-   switch from VS Code to the browser and debug your new code
