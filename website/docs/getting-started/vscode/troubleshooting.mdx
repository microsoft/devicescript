# Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

## DeviceScript CLI not installed

The development server runs the DeviceScript command line (`@devicescript/cli`) installed
locally in your project.
Make sure `@devicescript/cli` has been
added as a developer dependency to your project, and that dependencies have been installed.

```bash
npm add -D @devicescript/cli@latest
npm run install
```

## Node.JS won't start

The DeviceScript extension spawns a Node.JS process to
run the debugger adapter, connect to hardware device and build sources.
Depending on your machine configuration, you may have to specify where the Node.JS binaries
are located.

-   Open the **Settings**
-   Search for **DeviceScript node** and update the Node.JS binary path
-   Reload Visual Studio Code

## Port 8081 is used

It may happen that a previous session left the development server dangling, run this command to kill processes hanging on port `8081`.

```bash
npx kill-port 8081
```

## Serial connection won't connect

-   serial connection used by another application
-   make sure the [serialport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialport) package is installed
-   running in remote workspace
