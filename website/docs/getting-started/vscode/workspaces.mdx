# Local, Remote and Web Workspaces

In a local workspace, DeviceScript opens a native serial connection to communicate with hardware devices.

In a remote workspace, DeviceScript uses a separate browser window using WebSerial that communicates with
the localhost developer tools server.

In general, web editor is not supported.
