# Local and Remote Workspaces

In a local workspace, DeviceScript opens a native serial connection to communicate with hardware devices.

In a remote workspace, DeviceScript uses a separate browser window using WebSerial that communicates with
the localhost developer tools server.

In general, web editor is not supported.

-   (1) Using manual download of .UF2 files for RP2040 or the [Adafruit WebSerial ESPTool](https://adafruit.github.io/Adafruit_WebSerial_ESPTool/)
-   (2) Through a seperate browser window using WebSerial
-   (3) No board with USB connection supported yet

## Remote workspace

When using a remote workspace, the developer tool command line (that gets spawned by the Visual Studio extension)
cannot access physical devices.

To work around this issue, the extension launches a web page that uses WebSerial/WebUSB to connect
to the physical device and proxy the packets back to the local web server hosted by the developer tools.

The key difference between local and remote are:

-   the connection is done through a separate web page
    that needs to stay opened and in the foreground (browser aggressively throttle background pages)
-   the console output is displayed in the connection page rather than in the VS Code terminal
