# Blinky

The classic LED blinking program on a [Raspberry Pi Pico](/devices/rp2040). The LED is connected to the Pico's pin GP1 (2 on the silk)

<StaticVideo name="blinky" />

```ts
import { pins } from "@dsboard/pico"
import { startLightBulb } from "@devicescript/servers"

// start a lightbulb server on pin GP1
// and store client in `led` variable
const led = startLightBulb({
    pin: pins.P1,
})

// start interval timer every 1000ms
setInterval(async () => {
    // read current brightness
    const brightness = await led.intensity.read()
    // toggle on/off
    const newbrightness = brightness > 0 ? 0 : 1
    // apply new brightness
    await led.intensity.write(newbrightness)
}, 1000)
```

## ESP32

The classic LED blinking program on a [ESP32](/devices/esp32)
is similar. The LED is connected to the pin `A0`.

```ts
import { pins } from "@dsboard/adafruit_qt_py_c3"
import { startLightBulb } from "@devicescript/servers"

const lightBulb = startLightBulb({
    pin: pins.A0,
})

setInterval(async () => {
    await lightBulb.toggle()
}, 500)
```
