# Getting Started

## Try DeviceScript in your browser

You do not need hardware or install any tools to try out DeviceScript. Try running this snippet!

```ts edit
ds.everyMs(1000, () => {
    console.log(`hello`)
})
```

You can edit it directly and press `Edit` to load it in the DeviceScript simulator in the documentation.
You can also click on `Fork` and open the sample in CodeSandbox.

## Visual Studio Code extension

Visual Studio and the DeviceScript Extension provide the best developer experience, with building, deploying, debugging,
tracing, device monitoring and other developer productivity features.
