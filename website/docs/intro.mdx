# DeviceScript

DeviceScript brings a professional TypeScript developer experience to low-resource microcontroller-based devices.
DeviceScript is compiled to a custom VM bytecode, which can run in very constrained
environments (VM itself compiles to 10kB of code, with the floating point library and Jacdac SDK adding further 30kB).

#### TypeScript

The familiar syntax and tooling, all at your fingertips. Read the [language reference](/language).

#### Portable Virtual Machine

Small footprint DeviceScript bytecode interpreter. See [supported devices](/devices).

#### Hardware as Services

Write reusable application/firmware on top of abstract hardware services.

#### Small

Designed for low power, low flash, low memory embedded projects.

#### Simulation & Tracing

Develop and test your firmware using simulated or real sensors.

#### Debugging

Full debugging experience in Visual Studio Code, for hardware or simulated devices. Read about the [Visual Studio Extension](/getting-started/vscode).

#### Package Ecosystem

Leverage npm, yarn or pnpm to distribute and consume DeviceScript packages.
