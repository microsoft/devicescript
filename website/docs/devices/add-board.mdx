# Add Board

In DeviceScript, we commonly refere a Device Configuration as a `board`.

If your device is already using a supported chipset architecture,
you can create a new `board` configuration in your project to support it in DeviceScript.

## How to create a new board

### Create the new `board.json` file

You will need three pieces of information to start a new board: (1) the existing configuration
you will fork, (2) a name and (3) an identifier.

In [Visual Studio Code](/getting-started/vscode),
select **DeviceScript: Add Board...** from the command palette.

Using the [Command Line](/getting-started/cli), use the `add board` command and follow the instructions.

```bash
devicescript add board
```

After this process, you wil have a new JSON under `/boards/`. The command line and
Visual Studio Code will automatically integrate any configuration files in the `/boards` folder.

### Editing the generated Device configuration (.json) file

The new configuration file is a schematized JSON file. In Visual Studio Code, you will get tooltip, completion,
syntax errors and auto-completion.

-   [ ] Update the pin map
-   [ ] Update the board description
-   [ ] If available, prodive a URL where the board can be purchased

### Flash the new configuration

The command line and Visual Studio will automatically integrate any configuration file in the `boards/` folder.
The first should be to flash the firmware again using the new configuration.

In [Visual Studio Code](/getting-started/vscode),
select **DeviceScript: Flash Firmware...** from the command palette.
Using the [command line](/getting-started/cli), use the `flash` command.

## Contributing

If you have successfully crafted a configuration for your Device and you would like to share it with other users,
you can open a GitHub Issue at https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript and attach the .JSON file. The file will
be reviewed and integrate into the built-in list.
