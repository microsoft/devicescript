# Devices

This page links to various developer boards that have a DeviceScript runtime firmware.

For sensors and other peripherals, see [servers](/api/servers).

## Implementation status

| Device       | USB | TCP | TLS | I2C | SPI | GPIO | PWM | Jacdac |
| ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | --- | ------ |
| **WASM Sim** | N/A | ✓   | ✓   | ❌  | ❌  | ❌   | ❌  | ✓      |
| **ESP32**    | ⚠️  | ✓   | ✓   | ✓   | ✓   | ✓    | ✓   | ✓      |
| **ESP32-C3** | ✓   | ✓   | ✓   | ✓   | ✓   | ✓    | ✓   | ✓      |
| **ESP32-S2** | ✓   | ✓   | ❌  | ✓   | ✓   | ✓    | ✓   | ✓      |
| **ESP32-S3** | ✓   | ✓   | ✓   | ✓   | ✓   | ✓    | ✓   | ✓      |
| **RP2040**   | ✓   | ❌  | ❌  | ✓   | ✓   | ✓    | ✓   | ✓      |
| **RP2040-W** | ✓   | ✓   | ❌  | ✓   | ✓   | ✓    | ✓   | ✓      |

The PWM is currently only supported through servo, light bulb, buzzer and similar drivers.

**The ESP32-C3 boards are best supported.**
The regular ESP32 (without -C3 or -S2) currently have issues with the USB connection
(as it's handled by external chip).
The ESP32-S2 has limited memory which makes it difficult to use TLS.
The ESP32-S3 is very recent and largely untested.

The RP2040 should generally work, but TLS is not supported on Pico-W.

:::note

If you have ESP-IDF or Pico SDK expertise, we are actively looking for contributors to help
with the C embedded runtime. You can look at the [ESP32 issues](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/labels/esp32)
or the [RP2040 issues](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/labels/rp2040) for ideas.
There's also an incomplete [STM32 port](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript-stm32) if you
want to contribute there. It's also possible to [port to a new MCU/SoC](/devices/add-soc).

## Board recommendations

For [ESP32](/devices/esp32/),

-   [Adafruit QT Py C3](/devices/esp32/adafruit-qt-py-c3) and [FeatherS2](/devices/esp32/feather-s2) have
    [Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) aka [STEMMA QT](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/what-is-stemma-qt)
    connectors that make it easy to connect I2C sensors;
    there's also [Adafruit Feather ESP32-S2](/devices/esp32/adafruit-feather-esp32-s2) in the same
    category but it's untested
-   [Seeed Xiao ESP32C3](/devices/esp32/seeed-xiao-esp32c3)
-   [ESP32-C3-RUST](/devices/esp32/esp32c3-rust-devkit) has a builtin temperature/humidity and light sensors, and RGB LED

For [RP2040](/devices/rp2040/),

-   [Raspberry Pi Pico](/devices/rp2040/pico)
