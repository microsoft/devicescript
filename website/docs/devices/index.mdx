# Devices

This page links to various developer boards that have a DeviceScript runtime firmware.

For sensors and other peripherals, see [servers](/api/servers).

## Implementation status

**The ESP32-C3 and ESP32-S2 boards are best supported.**
The regular ESP32 (without -C3 or -S2) currently have issues with the USB connection
(as it's handled by external chip). 

The RP2040 should generally work, but networking is not supported on pico-w. See

:::note

If you have ESP-IDF or Pico SDK expertise, we are actively looking for contributors to help
with the C embedded runtime. You can look at the [ESP32 issues](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/labels/esp32)
or the [RP2040 issues](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/labels/rp2040) for ideas.

## Board recommendations

For ESP32,

-   [Adafruit QT Py C3](/devices/esp32/adafruit-qt-py-c3) and [FeatherS2](/devices/esp32/feather-s2) have
    [Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) aka [STEMMA QT](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/what-is-stemma-qt)
    connectors that make it easy to connect I2C sensors;
    there's also [Adafruit Feather ESP32-S2](/devices/esp32/adafruit-feather-esp32-s2) in the same
    category but it's untested
-   [Seeed Xiao ESP32C3](/devices/esp32/seeed-xiao-esp32c3)
-   [ESP32-C3-RUST](/devices/esp32/esp32c3-rust-devkit) has a builtin temperature/humidity and light sensors, and RGB LED

For RP2040,

-   [Raspberry Pi Pico](/devices/rp2040/pico)
