# Devices

This page links to various developer boards that have a DeviceScript runtime firmware.

## Hardware status

The ESP32-C3 and ESP32-S2 boards are best supported.
The regular ESP32 (without -C3 or -S2) currently have issues with the USB connection (as it's handled by external chip).

The RP2040 should generally work.

## [ESP32](/devices/esp32/)

{@import ./esp32/boards.mdp}

## [RP2040](/devices/rp2040/)

{@import ./rp2040/boards.mdp}

## [Periphericals](/devices/hw/)
