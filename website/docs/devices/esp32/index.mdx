# ESP32

The following devices use the firmware from https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-esp32.

-   [Adafruit QTPY ESP32 C3 WiFi Dev Board](/devices/esp32/adafruit-qt-py-esp32-c3-wifi-dev-board/)

The ESP32 boards can be flashed using `devicescript esp32` command.
You will need to install `esptool.py` first - you can do that using `pip install esptool`.
Once installed, connect your ESP32 board and run `devicescript esp32`, you should see something
like this:

```console
$ devicescript esp32
using serial port /dev/cu.usbmodem01 at 1500000

Please select board, available options:
    --board msr207_v42                 JM Brain S2-mini 207 v4.2
    --board msr207_v43                 JM Brain S2-mini 207 v4.3
    --board msr48                      JacdacIoT 48 v0.2
$
```

You can also run `devicescript esp32 --board list` to get a full list of ESP32 boards
without attempting any auto-detect.

Let's say your board is `adafruit_qt_py_c3`. To flush run `devicescript esp32 --board adafruit_qt_py_c3`:

```console
$ devicescript esp32 --board adafruit_qt_py_c3

If the esptool complains about not being able to connect, try plugging your board in
while holding `IO0`/`BOOT` button.
