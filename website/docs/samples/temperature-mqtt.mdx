# Temperature + MQTT

This sample uses an ESP32-C3 board [Adafruit QT Py C3](/devices/esp32/adafruit-qt-py-c3)
and a [SHTC3 sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4636) to publish a temperature reading to
the [Adafruit.io MQTT APIs](https://www.mqtt-dashboard.com/) every minute.

To make this work, you will to get an account with https://io.adafruit.com
and store your username and password in the [settings](/developer/settings)
as the `IO_USERNAME` and `IO_KEY` keys (make sure your key is in `env.local`).
Also create a feed and update the feed key in the example below.

```ts
// hardware configuration and drivers
import "@dsboard/adafruit_qt_py_c3"
import { startSHTC3 } from "@devicescript/drivers"
import { startMQTTClient } from "@devicescript/net"
// extra APIs
import { readSetting } from "@devicescript/settings"
import { schedule } from "@devicescript/runtime"

// mounting a temperature server for the SHTC3 sensor
const { temperature } = await startSHTC3()

// update feed key
const feed = "temperature"
const username = await readSetting("IO_USERNAME")
// this secret is stored in the .env.local and uploaded to the device settings
const password = await readSetting("IO_KEY")

const mqtt = await startMQTTClient({
    host: `io.adafruit.com`,
    proto: "tls",
    port: 8883,
    username,
    password,
})
// https://io.adafruit.com/api/docs/mqtt.html#feed-topic-format
const topic = `${username}/feeds/${feed}/json`

schedule(
    async () => {
        // read data from temperature sensor
        const value = await temperature.reading.read()
        // publish to feed topic
        await mqtt.publish(topic, { value })
    },
    { timeout: 1000, interval: 60000 }
)
```

## Filtering data

You could use [observables](/developer/observables) to smooth the sensor
data. For example, apply an exponentially moving average
on the feed of temperature readings.

```ts skip
import { ewma, auditTime } from "@devicescript/observables"
...
temperature.reading
    .pipe(ewma(0.5), auditTime(60000))
    .subscribe(async value => await mqtt.publish(topic, { value }))
```
