# Status Light Blinky

Many boards have integrated status LED that can be controlled using the `setStatusLight` function.

It's important to remember that the status LED is also used by DeviceScript to
indicate the status of the runtime, like a short red blink every half second.
So your color will get overriden by the system colors.
Therefore, keep your blinks short.

```ts
import { delay } from "@devicescript/core"
import { setStatusLight } from "@devicescript/runtime"

setInterval(async () => {
    // red
    await setStatusLight(0x100000)
    // wait 0.5s
    await delay(400)
    // blue
    await setStatusLight(0x000010)
    // wait 0.5s
    await delay(400)
}, 1)
```
