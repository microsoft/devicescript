### Add Core JavaScript APIs

The DeviceScript [core js library](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects) is not complete; but it is possible to fill the gaps
as needed. The requests are tracked by the [core js issue label](https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22core+js%22).

You will need a local development setup for these tasks.

If you want to add a new function:

-   find the corresponding function definition in one of the `lib/es....d.ts` file.
-   copy the definition in the corresponding interface in `packages/core/src/corelib.d.ts`
-   implement the function in the implementation file of the type (see `packages/core/src/array.ts` for example).
    If you are adding a new file, make sure to import it in `packages/core/src/index.ts`.
-   add test cases in the corresponding test file under `devs/run-tests`
-   build and test
-   create a pull request and go!

If you want to add a new Type, we currently have a limitation with the `core` package and you will need to add it to the `runtime` package:s

-   implement the class in the implementation file of the type (see `packages/runtime/src/map.ts` for example).
    If you are adding a new file, make sure to import it in `packages/runtime/src/map.ts`.
-   add test cases in the corresponding test file under `packages/runtime/src/main.ts`
-   build and test
-   create a pull request and go!

### Samples

Documentation samples are located under `website/docs/samples`.
Each `.mdx` file contains a single self-contained sample.

It is typically easiest to develop a sample in a dedicate `.ts` file
to leverage the editor's features, and then copy it to the `.mdx` file.

To run the docs locally, run `yarn docs`. This will launch the docusaurus development server
and refresh the documentation page on each edit.

If your sample requires multiple files, such as images,

-   create a folder with the same name as the `.mdx` file
-   move your `.mdx` file and rename it to `index.mdx`
-   add a `_category_.json` file with the front matter

```json
{
    "label": "Samples",
    "position": 3
}
```

### Documenting/patching console output

To add new substitions from console output message to pretty text + URL, do the following.

The `website/docs/developer/errors.mdx` gets parsed by builderrors.mjs.
The hash of the H2 titles is the console log look up key (replacing - with spaces) and the H2 text will replace that key + URL.

    loopback rx ovf --> Loopback buffer overflow (....#loopback-rx-ovf)

### Adding Builtin Packages

Adding a new package is more advanced scenario and most likely we should have a discussion prior to start this work. You are welcome to publish packages under your account in npm.

> A good question to start with: Do we need a new builtin package or should it be a new npm package?

Generally, search for `@devicescript/gpio` within the workspace. The main places that need updating is:

-   this file, `website/docs/developer/packages.mdx`
-   list in `plugin/src/plugin.ts`
-   list in `devs/run-test/allcompile.ts`

After adding a new packages, run `yarn` at the top-level to update workspace links,
followed by the usual `yarn build`.


## Local development

The development requirement will vary (widely) depending
on which part of DeviceScript you want to work on.

Using Visual Studio Code is strongly recommended.

### Repository structure

This repository contains:

-   [jacdac-c submodule](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-c), including sources for Jacdac client libraries and DeviceScript VM
-   `compiler/` - sources for DeviceScript compiler
-   `runtime/devicescript-vm/` - glue files to build DeviceScript VM as WASM module using [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/); `vm/dist/` contain pre-built files
-   `packages` - builtin packages and sample project (`packages/sampleprj`)
-   `runtime/posix/` - implementation of Jacdac SDK HAL for grown-up POSIX-like operating systems (as opposed to embedded platforms)
-   `vscode` - Visual Studio Code extension
-   `website` - docusaurus documentation side

### Compiler, runtime and command line

You can use the devcontainer to build. The instructions are tested for a Unix terminal.

If you want to build locally you need to install node.js. After cloning, the repo run

```bash
yarn setup
```

To run a watch build and the docs, run

```
nvm use 18
yarn dev
```

-   start `jacdac devtools` (the npm version) and let it run
-   open this folder in VSCode; use "Reopen in Container" if needed
-   start Terminal in VSCode
-   run `yarn install`
-   run `yarn build`
-   run `yarn devs run devs/samples/something.ts` - this will execute given DeviceScript program using the WASM binary

If you want to develop the runtime (as opposed to compiler or website), you will also need
GNU Make, C compiler, and [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html).
Once you have it all:

-   run `make native` to compile using native C compiler
-   run `yarn devs crun devs/samples/something.ts` - this will execute given DeviceScript program using the POSIX/native binary
-   run `./runtime/built/jdcli 8082` - this will run the POSIX/native DeviceScript server, which can be accessed from the devtools dashboard
-   run `make em` to compile using emscripten

### Visual Studio Extension

Open the Debug view in VSCode and run the `VSCode Extension` configuration. This will launch a new VSCode instance with the extension loaded. A build is automatically triggered before launch VSCode.

### Building packages

Similar to working on the Visual Studio Code extension, lunch the `VSCode Extension` debugger configuration. This will launch a new VSCode instance with the extension loaded.
It should also open the `packages` folder which will allow you to work on the built-in packages.

### Documentation

Run ``yarn docs` and edit any markdown file in the `website/docs` folder. The changes should be automatically picked up and rendered by docusaurus.

## Release process

Run `yarn bump` (or `make bump`). Alternatively, edit `img_version_patch` in `bytecode/bytecode.md` and push.

The cloud build will rebuild and check-in the VM, update version numbers in all `package.json` files, and publish them.

If you bump minor, you need to also bump the firmware repos:

-   go to each firmware repo (https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript-esp32, https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript-pico, https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript-stm32)
-   update the `devicescript` submodule
-   run

```bash
make bump
```
