# DeviceScript Virtual Machine

DeviceScript is a programming language for scripting [Jacdac](https://aka.ms/jacdac) services.

It has JavaScript-like syntax and is compiled to a custom VM bytecode, which can run in very constrained
environments (VM itself compiles to 10kB of code, with the floating point library and Jacdac SDK adding further 30kB).
