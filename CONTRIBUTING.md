## Repository structure

This repository contains:

-   [jacdac-c submodule](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-c), including sources for Jacdac client libraries and DeviceScript VM
-   `compiler/` - sources for DeviceScript compiler
-   `runtime/devicescript-vm/` - glue files to build DeviceScript VM as WASM module using [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/); `vm/dist/` contain pre-built files
-   `devs/samples/` - sample DeviceScript programs
-   `runtime/posix/` - implementation of Jacdac SDK HAL for grown-up POSIX-like operating systems (as opposed to embedded platforms)

## Usage

You can just use the devcontainer to build.

If you want to build locally you need to install node.js. After cloning, the repo run

```bash
yarn setup
```

To run a watch build and the docs, run

```
nvm use 18
yarn dev
```

-   start `jacdac devtools` (the npm version) and let is running
-   open this folder in VSCode; use "Reopen in Container" if needed
-   start Terminal in VSCode
-   run `yarn install`
-   run `yarn build`
-   run `devs run devs/samples/something.ts` - this will execute given DeviceScript program using the WASM binary

If you want to develop the runtime (as opposed to compiler or website), you will also need
GNU Make, C compiler, and [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html).
Once you have it all:

-   run `make native` to compile using native C compiler
-   run `devs crun devs/samples/something.ts` - this will execute given DeviceScript program using the POSIX/native binary
-   run `./runtime/built/jdcli 8082` - this will run the POSIX/native DeviceScript server, which can be accessed from the devtools dashboard
-   run `make em` to compile using emscripten

## Release process

Run `yarn bump` (or `make bump`). Alteratively, edit `img_version_patch` in `bytecode/bytecode.md` and push.

The cloud build will rebuild and check-in the VM, update version numbers in all `package.json` files, and publish them.

If you bump minor, you need to also bump the firmware repos:

- go to each firmware repo (https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-esp32, https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-pico, https://github.com/microsoft/devicescript-stm32)
- update the `devicescript` submodule
- run

```bash
make bump
```
